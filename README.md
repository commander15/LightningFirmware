**âš¡ Be light â€” and let it *glow*! ðŸŒˆâœ¨**

Let me take you on a quick dev journeyâ€¦

I recently built a fun little project called **Lightning** â€” a desktop app that lets you *pick a color on screen and watch it light up a real RGB LED* in perfect sync.  
Sounds simple? Sure. But the path to glowing glory had a few surprises. ðŸ˜„

It started with an idea:  
> "What if I could control an RGB LED with just a color picker from a Qt app?" ðŸ’­  
Next thing I knew, I was prototyping a custom board and writing serial communication logic between a Qt 6 **Widgets-based app** and an **Arduino** (via PlatformIO).  

ðŸŽ¯ The goals were clear:  
- A color picker that feels intuitive  
- Real-time LED feedback  
- A smooth and minimal UI  
- Cross-platform and open source

But of courseâ€¦ dev life happened.

ðŸ¤” *Challenge 1:* How do you embed a `QColorDialog` into a `QMainWindow` as a proper widget, not a pop-up?  
Letâ€™s just say that required a few flag flips and avoiding native dialogs.  
ðŸ‘‰ `Qt::Widget` + `DontUseNativeDialog` saved the day.

ðŸ§  *Challenge 2:* Getting the LED to reflect color accurately meant going beyond just sending 8-bit RGB values â€” I had to deal with analog output, brightness calibration, and LED limitations. Tiny tweaks made a big difference!

And today, the result is *Lightning* âš¡:  
ðŸ’» A Qt app that sends RGBA color codes via Serial  
ðŸ’¡ A microcontroller that reads, converts, and lights up  
ðŸŒˆ A live color preview right in the app  
ðŸŽ¯ And a real LED that responds instantly â€” it just *feels good*

Sometimes, itâ€™s the small projects that remind you how joyful dev can be â€” just color, code, and creativity.  
Stay curious. Stay lit. ðŸ’¡âš¡
